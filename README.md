# Module_19_fintech_finder.py

## The overall project goal
### As the lead developer, the task task is to build a new and disruptive application named KryptoJobs2Go and integrate the Ethereum blockchain network into the new application. The purpose is to enable the customers to instantly pay their hired fintech professionals with cryptocurrency.

## For this Challenge, the perspective of a KryptoJobs2Go customer was assumed in order to handle the following:

### To Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase

### To Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account
### address.

### To Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas
### estimate, that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work.

### To digitally sign a transaction that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate, and send
### this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

### To Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

### Once transactionâ€™s hash code is received, we then navigate to the Transactions
### section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. In order to confirm that
### you have successfully created the transaction, you will save screenshots to the
### README.md file of your GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.

## To complete this Challenge,two Python files were used:

### fintech_finder.py contains the code associated with the web interface of the application. The code included in this file is compatible with the Streamlit library.

### crypto_wallet.py contains the Ethereum transaction functions. By using import statements, I integrate the crypto_wallet.py Python script into the Fintech Finder ### interface program that is found in the fintech_finder.py file.

### Integrating these two files allow the user to automate the tasks associated with generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and ### sending transactions

## Steps Involved
### Step 1: Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application
### Step 2: Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction
### Step 3: Inspect the Transaction
